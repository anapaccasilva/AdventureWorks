# AdventureWorks

The AdventureWorks dataset is a sample database created by Microsoft to demonstrate how to design and implement a database using Microsoft SQL Server. It is a fictional company that sells bicycles and bicycle-related products, and the database contains information about their products, sales, customers, employees, and more.

This dataset was used for a cross-disciplinary project in the Business Intelligence Master's program at *UNIR - International University of La Rioja*, and the results achieved by me are presented here.
